## lgcommander-macros.py
lgcommander-macros.py is a python script for controlling your 2011 Smart Lg TV with your PC.
It can be used for gaining access to hidden menus and modes.

## Supported models:
Lg has released two TV remote control apps for android smartphones in Google Play app store; this script works with the same models listed for the 2011 TVs. If your TV is not on that list, it may not be controllable through a network connection and this script may not work for you.

## To use it you need:
A PC, with python 3.x installed, connected to the same network as your Lg TV.

## Some useful codes:

* for EZ_ADJUST menu enter 255
* for IN START menu enter 251
* for Installation menu enter 207
* for POWER_ONLY mode enter 254

Warning: do not enter 254 if you do not know what POWER_ONLY mode is. You can find additional information about menus and modes here: <http://openlgtv.org.ru>   
 
As long as you do not "factory reset" your TV, pairing key doesn't change.  If you just want to display your pairing key, run with the argument 'pair'.
